The format is defined by the following code:

For LM9:
    (*textfiles[i])<<m0_<<" "<<m12_<<" ";

    (*textfiles[i])<<SIG.rawYield<<" "<<SB.rawYield<<" "<<SIGSL.rawYield<<" "<<SBSL.rawYield<<" "<<SIGLDP.rawYield<<" "<<SBLDP.rawYield<<" "
		   <<SIG.effCorr<<" "<<SB.effCorr<<" "<<SIGSL.effCorr<<" "<<SBSL.effCorr<<" "<<SIGLDP.effCorr<<" "<<SBLDP.effCorr<<" "
	    <<SIG.totalSystematic<<" "<<SB.totalSystematic<<" "<<SIGSL.totalSystematic<<" "<<SBSL.totalSystematic<<" "<<SIGLDP.totalSystematic<<" "<<SBLDP.totalSystematic<<endl;

For mSugra there is one extra field -- the Number of Entries generated at that point is the 3rd column.

Systematics are in %.

For LM9, the total systematic does not include PDF uncertainties. The best estimate we have for LM9 PDF uncertainties is 13%.

For mSugra, all uncertainties have been included.

In both cases the lumi uncertainty is included.
