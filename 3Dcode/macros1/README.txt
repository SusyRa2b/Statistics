     These macros should get you set up with a working set of files after
     a clean CVS checkout.  Do this from the 3Dcode directory

       source macros1/sourceme-geninput
       source macros1/sourceme-makews
       source macros1/sourceme-fitqual

     This is for the 4x4 METxHT binning, which is hardwired into several
     of the source files.
