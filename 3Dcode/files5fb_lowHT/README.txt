*) The first version of the (currently available) 8TeV MC,
   normalized to *** 15 fb-1 *** is:

  /afs/cern.ch/work/g/gaz/public/RA2b/3Dfit/files15fb_8TeV/
  (requiring minimum pT for a "good jet" to be > 50 GeV)



*) The most recent versions of the root files to be used is:

  /afs/cern.ch/work/g/gaz/public/RA2b/3Dfit/files5fb_MT_pt30/
  (requiring minimum pT for a "good jet" to be > 30 GeV)

  /afs/cern.ch/work/g/gaz/public/RA2b/3Dfit/files5fb_MT_pt50/
  (requiring minimum pT for a "good jet" to be > 50 GeV)

  which are identical to the previous one, but the variables
  "pt_3rd_leadJet", "MT" and "TypeI_MT" have been added.


*) The previous version is:

  /afs/cern.ch/work/g/gaz/public/RA2b/3Dfit/files5fb_veryLowHT/

  which implements:

  - the HT cut has been lowered to 150;
  - TypeI_MET has been added to the tree;
  - the pT of the two leading jets has been added (pt_1st_leadJet and pt_2nd_leadJet)


*) The older files are here:
