   Figure 3: Data / MC comparison of MET distributions
   Figure 4: Data / MC comparison of HT distributions
   Figure 5: Data / MC comparison of nbjet distributions

     Code to fill them (make the root file):
       UserCode/SusyAnalysis/RA2b/Statistics/3Dcode/dmc_fillplots_btw.c

     Inputs for drawing macro:
       UserCode/SusyAnalysis/RA2b/Statistics/3Dcode/an-plot-macros/dmc-root-files/dmc_plots_btw_RunsABCDT.root
       UserCode/SusyAnalysis/RA2b/Statistics/3Dcode/an-plot-macros/fitresults-ws-data-unblind-susyFixed0.0.txt

     Drawing macro:
       UserCode/SusyAnalysis/RA2b/Statistics/3Dcode/dmc_drawplots2_fitnorm.c

     Output:
       Lots of pdf files will go to a subdirectory of UserCode/SusyAnalysis/RA2b/Statistics/3Dcode/
       called outputfiles.  You need to make that directory first.

     Notes:
       Run the dmc_drawplots2_fitnorm.c draw code from UserCode/SusyAnalysis/RA2b/Statistics/3Dcode/
       The first argument is the root file and the second the fitresults file.
       If you leave the 3, 4, and 5th arguments alone, it will go through all of the plots
       and put them in outputfiles.

   Figure 6: ttwj closure plots.

     Code to fill the input distributions:
        UserCode/SusyAnalysis/RA2b/Statistics/3Dcode/GenerateInputFile.C
        Needs filesMoriond_v3 linked to above directory for input tiny trees.

     Code that does the closure analysis, makes, and draws the plots
        UserCode/SusyAnalysis/RA2b/Statistics/3Dcode/mcclosure4.c

     Output:
        files go into outputfiles subdirectory of UserCode/SusyAnalysis/RA2b/Statistics/3Dcode
        Look for gi*.pdf

     Notes:
        To run everything, go to UserCode/SusyAnalysis/RA2b/Statistics/3Dcode and do
        source macros1/sourceme-everything-part1-Moriond
        To remake the plots only, after sourcing this once, all you need to run is the
        mcclosure4 step.

   Figure 7: QCD closure plots.

     Code to fill the input distributions: (same as ttwj closure above)

     Code that does the closure analysis, makes, and draws the plots: (same as ttwj above)

     Output:
       files go into outputfiles subdirectory of UserCode/SusyAnalysis/RA2b/Statistics/3Dcode
       Look for mcclosure4-qcd*.pdf

     Notes:
        See notes for ttwj closure above.

   Figure 8: Fit results for high-sensitivity bins.

     Inputs:
       UserCode/SusyAnalysis/RA2b/Statistics/3Dcode/an-plot-macros/scan-results-19fb.txt
       UserCode/SusyAnalysis/RA2b/Statistics/3Dcode/datfiles_19fb/data-vals-unblind.dat
       UserCode/SusyAnalysis/RA2b/Statistics/3Dcode/an-plot-macros/dmc-root-files/dmc_plots2_RunsABCDT-as-drawn.root
       (the root file above is not used for the plots.)

     Code to draw the plots:
       UserCode/SusyAnalysis/RA2b/Statistics/3Dcode/an-plot-macros/unbiased_fit_hsbins_plots.c
       UserCode/SusyAnalysis/RA2b/Statistics/3Dcode/an-plot-macros/full_fit_hsbins_plots.c

     Notes:
       Run the code from UserCode/SusyAnalysis/RA2b/Statistics/3Dcode/an-plot-macros
       Note that the SaveAs() method of TCanvas does not save these properly, so
       I have been making a png file of the canvas.
