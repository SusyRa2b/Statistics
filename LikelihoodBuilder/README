CVS checkout:
========================================
cvs co -r HEAD -d LikelihoodBuilder UserCode/SusyAnalysis/RA2b/Statistics/LikelihoodBuilder


The way to build a likelihood is:
========================================
If you are on lxplus, you can get a compatible version of root by doing 'source setupRooFit.csh'.

If you don't have your own input files, you can use the example checked in here.  You must do 'cp bin1.dat bin2.dat' and 'cp bin1.dat bin3.dat' to create all of the required input files.

root -l
.x setup.C
buildLikelihood("exampleInput/setupFile.dat","exampleInput/binFilesFile.dat","exampleInput/", "exampleInput/sig1/","ws","test.root")

The way to fit is (after building likelihood):
=========================================
If you are on lxplus, you can get a compatible version of root by doing 'source setupRooFit.csh'.

root -l
.x setup.C
.x minimalFit.C+


The way to do a profile likelihood scan is (after building likelihood):
=========================================
If you are on lxplus, you can get a compatible version of root by doing 'source setupRooFit.csh'.

root -l
.x setup.C
.x minimalProfileLikelihood.C+


Some additional info:
=========================================
The .dat files define a likelihood.  The setupFile.dat is just a dummy
setup of numbers
used in every bin.  The bin1, bin2, and bin3 files are just dummy
files of 3 identical
count selections that would need to be modified to be real selections.

The signalModelFile.dat is setup as:

m0 m12 numberOfEvents bin1SignalCount bin1SignalUncertainty bin1LowDeltaPhiNCount bin1LowDeltPhiNCountUncertainty bin1OneLeptonCount bin1OneLeptonCountUncertainty bin2SignalCount bin2SignalUncertainty bin2LowDeltaPhiNCount bin2LowDeltPhiNCountUncertainty bin2OneLeptonCount bin2OneLeptonCountUncertainty bin3SignalCount bin3SignalUncertainty bin3LowDeltaPhiNCount bin3LowDeltPhiNCountUncertainty bin3OneLeptonCount bin3OneLeptonCountUncertainty
