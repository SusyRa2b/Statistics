CVS checkout:
========================================
cvs co -r HEAD -d LikelihoodBuilder UserCode/SusyAnalysis/RA2b/Statistics/LikelihoodBuilder


The way to run this is:
========================================
If you are on lxplus, you can get root by doing 'source setupRooFit.csh'.
root -l
.L RooRatio.cxx+
.L likelihoodBuilder.C+
buildLikelihood("setupFile.dat","binFilesFile.dat","signalModelFile.dat",1,"workspace","test.root")


Some additional info:
=========================================
The .dat files define a likelihood.  The setupFile.dat is just a dummy
setup of numbers
used in every bin.  The bin1, bin2, and bin3 files are just dummy
files of 3 identical
count selections that would need to be modified to be real selections.

The signalModelFile.dat is setup as:

m0 m12 numberOfEvents bin1SignalCount bin1SignalUncertainty bin2SignalCount
bin2SignalUncertainty bin3SignalCount bin3SignalUncertainty
